## bugs

* sorting not correct when 1) sorting elements 2) then creating new elements 3) reload

	+ $jQ(document) is not working
	+ tried to reinitialize .sortable after description change, but not working

* context might be just #, without a text -> prevent that

## features

### stopwatch

* add grey icon to indicate loading? sometime the website is slow. 
 
### summary

* shortcut application to send wget calls to post new tisheets

	+ use application key for that, not user login

## enhancements

- general

	* all ajax calls should only be possible with the currently logged in user -> check in controllers for user

- css

	* make textfields bigger with more padding, see toggl.com
	* use colors for contexts
