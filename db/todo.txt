# yaTimesheet

## bugs

* sorting not correct when 1) sorting elements 2) then creating new elements 3) reload
* context might be just #, without a text -> prevent that

## features

* shortcut application to send wget calls to post new tisheets
   + use application key for that, not user login

## enhancements

- general

   * all ajax calls should only be possible with the currently logged in user -> check in controllers for user
   * width of textfields

- css

   * make textfields bigger with more padding, see toggl.com
   * use colors for contexts
